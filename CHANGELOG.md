## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.3] — 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Message processing is now thread-batched instead of per-message.
  Each root message id (`envelope_id` of the thread root) is a single
  slot in the priority queue; new messages on the same thread coalesce
  into the existing slot, a higher-priority arrival bumps the slot but
  preserves the batch cursor, and the consumer drains the full batch
  in one `on_message_batch` dispatch. The agent reads the whole thread
  and decides on its own who to reply to — no trigger-message concept.
- Cross-restart dedup: a new `thread_processing_state(root_id PK,
  last_processed_sent_at)` table records the last `sent_at` drained
  per thread. On startup the runtime skips anything at or below that
  cursor so a crash mid-batch doesn't replay the whole thread.
- Pre-dispatch jitter (0.0–1.5s) before each batch is sent to the
  agent. When multiple agents on the same host get activated by one
  broadcast message, unblocked dispatch sends them all into the
  claude-code API simultaneously and trips its rate limit; the
  random sleep desynchronises them. Each agent picks its own delay
  independently — no host-wide coordination needed.

### Fixed

- Thread-batched dispatch could feed the agent the same envelope
  multiple times in one batch when the server's pending-message
  redelivery overlapped with live WS delivery (most easily reproduced
  after a daemon restart). `MessageStore.store` already used
  `INSERT OR IGNORE`, but the in-memory `_ThreadEntry.messages`
  batch had no envelope-level dedup. Now `_admit_thread_message`
  drops the append when the incoming `envelope_id` is already in the
  pending batch.
- cli-local adapter silently dropped MCP servers passed via
  `--mcp-config`. claude-code gates MCP registration on the per-
  project trust dialog stored in `~/.claude.json`, and the dialog has
  no TUI surface under `--input-format stream-json`, so it never
  resolved. Switched the `bypassPermissions` permission-mode to emit
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (which also bypasses the trust
  dialog) instead of `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (which
  only bypasses per-tool prompts). cli-docker already used the right
  flag; this aligns cli-local.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-10

First public PyPI release.

### Added

- Trusted Publishing workflows for PyPI and TestPyPI under
  `.github/workflows/`.

### Fixed

- `/spaces/<id>/events` pagination used the wrong query param
  (`cursor=` instead of `since=`); axum's `Query` extractor silently
  ignored it, so the agent's `_resolve_channel_name` loop fetched
  page 1 forever — pinning a worker's CPU and growing its WS receive
  queue until the host OOM'd. Also added a defensive strict-advance
  guard in the same loop and in the MCP `list_channels` tool, so a
  future server-side regression that echoes the same cursor back
  bails instead of spinning.
