## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.3] — 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Message processing is now thread-batched instead of per-message.
  Each root message id (`envelope_id` of the thread root) is a single
  slot in the priority queue; new messages on the same thread coalesce
  into the existing slot, a higher-priority arrival bumps the slot but
  preserves the batch cursor, and the consumer drains the full batch
  in one `on_message_batch` dispatch. The agent reads the whole thread
  and decides on its own who to reply to — no trigger-message concept.
- Cross-restart dedup: a new `thread_processing_state(root_id PK,
  last_processed_sent_at)` table records the last `sent_at` drained
  per thread. On startup the runtime skips anything at or below that
  cursor so a crash mid-batch doesn't replay the whole thread.
- Pre-dispatch jitter (0.0–1.5s) before each batch is sent to the
  agent. When multiple agents on the same host get activated by one
  broadcast message, unblocked dispatch sends them all into the
  claude-code API simultaneously and trips its rate limit; the
  random sleep desynchronises them. Each agent picks its own delay
  independently — no host-wide coordination needed.
- Status telemetry follows the thread-batch lifecycle. The first
  message in a batch still gets a single `/processing/start`
  (yellow dot lands there), but the per-message `/end` fan-out is
  replaced by a single `/messages/processing/end:batch` call that
  flips every message in the batch to green at once. Requires the
  puffo-server endpoint added in puffo-server#46 (deployed
  2026-05-11).

### Fixed

- Thread-batched dispatch could feed the agent the same envelope
  multiple times in one batch when the server's pending-message
  redelivery overlapped with live WS delivery (most easily reproduced
  after a daemon restart). `MessageStore.store` already used
  `INSERT OR IGNORE`, but the in-memory `_ThreadEntry.messages`
  batch had no envelope-level dedup. Now `_admit_thread_message`
  drops the append when the incoming `envelope_id` is already in the
  pending batch.
- A duplicate WS delivery that landed during a successful dispatch
  was being added to a fresh batch and re-fed to the agent on the
  next turn — observed as the same `envelope_id` appearing twice
  across consecutive claude-code turns (with a system-reminder
  injected between them). The handle_envelope cursor check couldn't
  catch it because `mark_thread_processed` runs *after* the dispatch
  finishes, and the in-batch dedup couldn't catch it because the
  consumer empties `entry.messages` to claim the batch. Adds a per-
  thread `dispatching_ids` set populated at claim time and consulted
  at the top of `_admit_thread_message`; cleared after the cursor
  advances on successful dispatch.
- Belt-and-suspenders: the consumer now dedupes `batch` by
  `envelope_id` one final time immediately before invoking
  `on_message_batch`, logging a warning if anything is dropped. The
  agent must never see the same envelope twice in one turn, even if
  some upstream race we haven't characterised slips through.
- `AgentAPIError` retry was duplicating the user input in the
  agent's claude-code transcript on every retry. When claude-code
  returns `API Error: Server is temporarily limiting requests`, the
  consumer re-enqueues the batch and `handle_message_batch` runs
  again — and the cli adapter `--resume`s the same claude-code
  session, so the same user message got appended to the transcript
  once per retry. A receiver who saw `×4` was hitting the rate
  limit four times before succeeding, with each attempt being a
  legitimate retry of one real wire delivery. Adds
  `Adapter.invalidate_session()` (implemented in cli-local /
  cli-docker via a new `ClaudeSession.invalidate`) and calls it in
  `_run_turn_and_route` right before re-raising `AgentAPIError`.
  Each retry now starts a fresh claude-code session with no
  `--resume`, so the agent's transcript shows the input exactly
  once. Tracks `_appended_envelope_ids` on the `PuffoAgent` so the
  retry's `handle_message_batch` doesn't re-`_append_user` the
  same envelope into `self.log` either.
- cli-docker now auto-recreates a reused container when its
  `/opt/puffoagent-pkg` bind mount no longer resolves to the host
  path that contains `puffo_agent` (typical cause: the operator
  reinstalled puffo-agent from a different path, e.g. moved off
  `puffo-core-han-group/agent` to the standalone repo). Without
  this, `python3 -m puffo_agent.mcp.puffo_core_server` inside the
  container would fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`, claude-code's
  MCP subprocess wouldn't initialise, and every puffo MCP tool
  surfaced as "No such tool available". Detected by `docker exec
  test -f /opt/puffoagent-pkg/puffo_agent/__init__.py`.
- `AgentAPIError` retry path was clobbering mid-dispatch arrivals.
  When the dispatch failed AND a new message had landed on the same
  thread during the failed dispatch (admitted through the reopen
  branch of `_admit_thread_message`), the handler set
  `entry.messages = batch` and silently dropped the new message.
  The retry now dedupe-prepends the failed batch to whatever is
  already in `entry.messages` so the next attempt carries both.
- cli-local adapter silently dropped MCP servers passed via
  `--mcp-config`. claude-code gates MCP registration on the per-
  project trust dialog stored in `~/.claude.json`, and the dialog has
  no TUI surface under `--input-format stream-json`, so it never
  resolved. Switched the `bypassPermissions` permission-mode to emit
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (which also bypasses the trust
  dialog) instead of `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (which
  only bypasses per-tool prompts). cli-docker already used the right
  flag; this aligns cli-local.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-05-10

First public PyPI release.

### Added

- Trusted Publishing workflows for PyPI and TestPyPI under
  `.github/workflows/`.

### Fixed

- `/spaces/<id>/events` pagination used the wrong query param
  (`cursor=` instead of `since=`); axum's `Query` extractor silently
  ignored it, so the agent's `_resolve_channel_name` loop fetched
  page 1 forever — pinning a worker's CPU and growing its WS receive
  queue until the host OOM'd. Also added a defensive strict-advance
  guard in the same loop and in the MCP `list_channels` tool, so a
  future server-side regression that echoes the same cursor back
  bails instead of spinning.
